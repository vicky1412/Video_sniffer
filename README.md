# Video_sniffer

It is downloader application.

I need to download a large no of video file from a website
and it has mouse-left protected.

i researched in the inspect elements and i found the video url link 
and my goodness was all video are in sequential url names, its a big
advantage to me.

So, i coded a application which request the url and download the video
highlights : 1: download with the filename
             2: create a respective folders
             
It is not gui its cmd only but it has crasy banner and downloader progress bar.

language : python
module used : requests, pynput, os, subprocess.

Thank you.
